# The Sparks Foundations
Interships Tasks for Data Science &amp; Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation 

## Beginner Level
-  Prediction using Supervised ML
    -    Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
    -    This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
    -    You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
    -    DataSet : http://bit.ly/w-data
    -    Sample Solution  https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ
    -    What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

-  Prediction using Unsupervised ML
    -  From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
    -  Using Python or perform this task
    -  Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
    -  Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j

-  Exploratory Data Analysis  Retail
    -  Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
    -  As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
    -  What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
    -  You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

## Intermediate Level
-  Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
   -  Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
   -  As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
   -  What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
   -  Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
  

- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
   -  Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
   -  The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
